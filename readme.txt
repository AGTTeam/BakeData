                   *****************************************

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game on your computer using a legal copy of the ROM. 

-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/
-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite
-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM, as an '.iso' filetype.
-For 'XDelta patch', choose the 'BakemonogatariPatch.xdelta' file.
-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!

*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you’d like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick “Backup original file”. This will create a new ‘--PATCHED.iso’ file instead.

                   *               II. Notes               *
                   *****************************************
EMULATION ISSUES
When emulating the game, you may experience some visual errors (lines, spots on models etc) if postprocessing shaders are applied, or if the internal rendering resolution or texture scaling is set too high. Some movies may also have grey box(es) near the beginning, which can’t be fixed by changing the settings.

Both of these issues are present in the unpatched game and do not happen on real hardware.

SLOW TEXT LOAD
The text may sometimes take a while to render for the first time, leading to empty menus/missing choices. This is an issue present in the original game, and is more apparent on hardware.

SAVE GAME TEXT
Any saves made in the unpatched version of the game will still show the save information in Japanese until overwritten. 

COMMUNICATION MODE
The game contains an ad hoc mode allowing two local players to go head-to-head. To the best of our knowledge, this has been fully translated, but we were unable to test it so there may be some errors. 

BATTLE UI DISPLAY
It is not explained in the game controls, but pressing the up/down buttons on the D-Pad toggles the display for the battle gauges and subtitles respectively.

                         ==========================
                          CHANGES MADE TO THE GAME 
                         ==========================

BUTTON SWAPS
The game originally followed the Japanese control scheme, wherein O = select and X = back. These have been swapped in the patch.

VERTICAL TEXT
All instances of vertical text in the game were replaced with rotated text, to allow for more characters to be used.

SUBTITLE CENTERING
The in-battle subtitles were changed from being left aligned to centered, to be consistent with the movies (which are centered in the original version as well.) 

ALPHABETICAL SORT
Filtering lines in alphabetical order originally sorted them into Japanese "aiueo" order. This was changed to follow Latin alphabetical order.

INSTALL DATA
The install data was designed to speed up load times for those playing the game using a UMD, by installing data from the UMD to the Memory Card.
While it can still be installed, the patched game will ignore the install data, and the prompt to install it when starting a new game has also been removed.

This was done because editing the install data to make it function with the patch would make it incompatible with the original game, and that install data serves no purpose to those playing the game with an emulator/the majority of people playing on hardware.

REMINISCENCE/DELUSION SUBTITLES
#todo
